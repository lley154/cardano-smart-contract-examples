# Helios Examples
The examples in this repository are part of the book

### [Cardano Smart Contracts with Helios](https://github.com/lley154/helios-examples/blob/main/docs/Cardano%20Smart%20Contracts%20with%20Helios.pdf)
#### Author: Lawrence Ley B.Sc.

The book is focused on making the onboarding experience for new developers to Cardano as easy and as straightforward as possible.  There is a lot of ground to cover so we start from the basics and go all the way to more sophisticated real world examples including both on-chain and off-chain code.  We wrap up the book with blockchain monitoring, troubleshooting techniques and production readiness.

### List of examples in increasing order of complexity

2) [nft](/nft) - mints an NFT ([video](https://youtu.be/5iPqe-HNIUE)) 
3) [emulator](/emulator) - uses the Helios emulator to mint a thread token without connecting to a real network

5) [nft-multisig](/nft-multisig) - mints a multi signature NFT ([video](https://youtu.be/CSd9ev_XH5w))
